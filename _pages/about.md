<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Jinglong Gao, a Ph.D. student in Research Center for Social Computing and Interactive Robotics (SCIR), at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT, China). I am co-advised by Prof. Ting Liu and Prof. Xiao Ding. My research interests include causal reasoning, intelligent agents (self-evolution, transfer and generalization), and slow thinking for LLMs.
